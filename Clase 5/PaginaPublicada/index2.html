			<p class="post"> Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) expands upon the team-based action gameplay that the franchise pioneered when it was launched 12 years ago. CS:GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust, etc.). In addition, CS:GO introduces new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more. <br><br>
			<strong class="subtitle">GAME MODES</strong><br><br>
			Classic: Competitive<br>
			This is the classic gameplay that made Counter-Strike famous. Queue up and join a 5v5 best-of-30 match using standard competitive Counter-Strike rules on one of the classic maps. You can join a match on your own, or form a team and enter a match as a unit.
	 		<br>
			Classic: Casual<br>
			Ready to play some Counter-Strike, but don’t want to commit to a full match? Find a casual match and play at your own pace. In Casual mode, players automatically receive body armor and defusal kits and gain bonus rewards for kills.
	 		<br>
			Demolition<br>
			In demolition mode, players take turns attacking and defending a single bombsite in a series of maps designed for fast-paced gameplay. Players are automatically granted a starting weapon, and advance through a sequence of firearms when they register a kill. If you’re up to the challenge, you can try to register a kill each round and reach the ultimate weapons, powerful sniper rifles!<br><a href="Information.html"> <span class="nav">READ MORE INFO</span></a>

Weapons in <b>bold</b> are weapons introduced in Global Offensive. Weapons in <i>italics</i> replaced an old gun and its role. They retain the same basic attributes and are officially considered the "successor". <br><br>
